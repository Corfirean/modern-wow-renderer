# Modern WoW Renderer

Modern WoW Renderer is a 32-bit Direct3D 9 proxy (`d3d9.dll`) that adds modern lighting, atmosphere, water, weather, and post-processing effects to the World of Warcraft client used by [Project Ascension](https://ascension.gg/).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is developed and tested for the **Ascension client**. It is **not tested with a stock World of Warcraft 3.3.5 client**. The renderer is under active development, so visual glitches, compatibility problems, crashes, and performance regressions may still occur.

> [!WARNING]
> **AI Materials are not implemented as a supported feature yet.** The repository contains experimental material-cache code and configuration placeholders, but they are incomplete, disabled by default, and should not be treated as part of the current release.

## Current features

### Atmosphere and volumetric lighting

- Depth-aware sun and moon shafts use the client's scene depth and tracked celestial direction.
- Height fog, aerial haze, ground mist, and animated terrain-relative local fog are integrated in world space.
- Local fog follows terrain, continues to evolve while the player is standing still, and reacts to player movement with a configurable wake.
- Temporal accumulation and edge-aware upsampling reduce noise without drawing over the interface.

### Dynamic environment lighting

- Trusted native point and spot lights can illuminate nearby world surfaces.
- Strong local lights contribute to volumetric scattering in fog and mist.
- Held torches and lanterns retain their light while the player briefly occludes the source from the camera.
- Screen-space occlusion and depth-derived normals keep the effect attached to visible geometry.

### Weather

- Native rain and snow receive replacement textures, intensity, speed, wind, and depth-occlusion controls.
- A depth-aware continuity layer keeps precipitation visible while moving quickly on a mount.
- Weather state survives short native-particle gaps caused by opening the F7 menu or returning from Alt+Tab.
- Optional rain lens droplets and an atmosphere-haze response are available.

### Water

- Screen-space reflections and environment fallback reflections.
- Refraction, depth absorption, shoreline foam, ripples, Fresnel response, and sun glint.
- Texture-signature matching covers liquid shader variants without splitting a continuous water surface.

### Native shadows and post-processing

- Softness and strength controls enhance the client-created cascaded shadow maps.
- Optional brightness, contrast, gamma, and sharpness post-processing.
- Native distance-fog controls remain available for compatibility with the client's own fog path.

## Known limitations

- AI Materials, generated normal maps, parallax relief, and material self-shadowing are still experimental and are not implemented as a supported release feature.
- Native-shadow enhancement only works when the Ascension client creates its own shadow maps.
- Dynamic lights and weather detection rely on observed Ascension render patterns; unusual zones, spells, addons, or future client updates can expose missed cases.
- D3D9 device resets, Alt+Tab transitions, uncommon depth formats, and third-party overlays remain compatibility-sensitive even though the common paths are covered by regression tests.
- This mod is in active development. Bugs are expected; include `ModernWoWRenderer.log`, the zone, and reproduction steps when reporting one.

## Controls

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `F7` | Open or close the grouped in-game tuning menu. |
| `F9` | Capture one diagnostic frame when celestial diagnostics are enabled. |
| `F10` | Toggle weather visuals. |
| `F11` | Toggle all injected graphics effects. |
| `F12` | Reload `GraphicsEffects.ini` without restarting the client. |

`F8` is reserved for the unfinished AI Materials development path and is not a supported user control.

F7 saves atmospheric, lighting, water and weather settings separately for each location. Select `Entire zone` to edit settings inherited by its subareas, or `This subarea` for a more specific override. Subarea values take priority over zone values. The `IMAGE & COLOR (GLOBAL)` block always uses the shared `GraphicsEffects.ini`, including the post-process toggle. Existing local color overrides are ignored.

Location presets automatically recognize the verified Ascension executable SHA-256 `e7c2a69cb86804eb9e21254b7b45c6a03e532d8b8f94451d9e0855f7535f97c6` when `[LocationProvider] ExeSHA256` is blank. Releases include `data/areas.txt`, exported from the verified client's loaded tables. Keep the `data` folder next to the DLL. Other executable versions need [environment setup and validation](docs/ENVIRONMENT-SYSTEM-RU.md). Unknown clients keep local presets locked; global image/color remains editable. Existing explicit client configurations are respected.

If F7 is locked, unresponsive, or fails to save, open F7 and reproduce the problem, then send `MenuDiagnostics.log` from the client directory with a screenshot. It records the build, executable hash, location validation, database status, viewport/client sizes, and save/render failures. It rotates at 1 MiB to `MenuDiagnostics.log.previous`. If no log exists, include `ModernWoWRenderer.log`. F12 reloads both settings and the area database; installing a new DLL requires restarting the game.

## Installation

1. Download the newest ZIP from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Corfirean/modern-wow-renderer/releases).
2. Extract its contents into the Ascension client directory, next to the game executable.
3. Confirm that `d3d9.dll`, `ModernWoWRenderer.ini`, and `GraphicsEffects.ini` are in that directory. Keep the packaged `textures` and `MaterialCache` directories beside them.
4. Start the client normally. Use `F7` to tune the effects and `F12` after editing `GraphicsEffects.ini` by hand.

Example layout:

```text
Ascension/
├── d3d9.dll
├── ModernWoWRenderer.ini
├── GraphicsEffects.ini
├── MaterialCache/
│   ├── local_light_manifest.json
│   └── LocalLightReview.json
└── textures/
    └── weather/
```

Remove or rename `d3d9.dll` to disable the proxy completely.

## Configuration

`ModernWoWRenderer.ini` contains proxy-wide switches, depth-capture preferences, and diagnostic controls. Most users should leave it unchanged.

`GraphicsEffects.ini` contains the live visual settings:

| Section | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `[Atmosphere]` | Volumetric quality, fog density, shafts, temporal filtering, and debug views. |
| `[LocalFog]` | Terrain-relative fog height, density, flow, and player wake. |
| `[DynamicLighting]` | Local-light intensity, volumetric contribution, quality, and debug modes. |
| `[WeatherVisuals]` | Rain/snow intensity, speed, wind, occlusion, lens droplets, and haze. |
| `[Water]` | Reflections, refraction, ripples, foam, absorption, Fresnel, and glint. |
| `[NativeShadows]` | Enhancement of the client's native shadow softness and strength. |
| `[PostProcess]` | Global enable switch, brightness, contrast, gamma, and sharpness. Always saved in `GraphicsEffects.ini`; location overrides are ignored. |
| `[DistanceFog]` | Scaling for the client's native distance fog. |
| `[AIMaterials]` | Unfinished experimental placeholder; keep disabled. |

The F7 overlay writes supported values back to `GraphicsEffects.ini`. Manual edits can be applied with `F12`.

## Building locally

Requirements:

- Visual Studio 2026 with the MSVC C++ x86/x64 tools and `v145` platform toolset.
- Windows SDK and MSBuild.
- A 32-bit `Win32` build target. The Ascension client is a 32-bit D3D9 process.

Build from a Visual Studio developer PowerShell:

```powershell
msbuild ModernWoWRenderer.sln /m /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=Win32 /p:PlatformToolset=v145
```

The installable output is written to `build\Release\`. The post-build step copies both INI files, the local-light manifests, and weather textures alongside `d3d9.dll`.

## Continuous integration and releases

`.github/workflows/build.yml` builds both Debug and Release configurations for every pull request targeting `main` and every push to `main`. It uses GitHub's `windows-2025-vs2026` image and verifies the DLL and both configuration files.

Every successful push to `main` also creates a GitHub Release containing an install-ready ZIP with:

- `d3d9.dll`
- `ModernWoWRenderer.ini`
- `GraphicsEffects.ini`
- `EnvironmentProfiles.ini` (location verification and environment configuration)
- required `MaterialCache` manifests
- packaged weather textures

The Release build is also retained as a workflow artifact for 14 days.

## Validation

The repository includes focused regression and shader checks:

```powershell
tools\Test-Atmosphere.cmd
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\ValidateShaders.ps1
```

The tests cover fog-field coverage and motion, weather continuity, held-light lifetime, depth-capture policies, and embedded shader compilation. Final visual verification still requires the Ascension client because these effects depend on its real draw order, shaders, textures, and device-reset behavior.

```

The proxy loads the system Direct3D 9 runtime, forwards the normal API, observes Ascension's render state, and injects its passes before the user interface. It does not replace game data files or network behavior.

## Reporting bugs

Open a GitHub issue with:

- the Ascension client build and zone;
- the effect and settings involved;
- exact reproduction steps, including whether Alt+Tab, F7, a mount, or a device reset is involved;
- `ModernWoWRenderer.log` and a screenshot or short video when available.

Reports from stock 3.3.5 clients are still useful, but that client is currently outside the tested compatibility target.
